In the modern era, there have been a lot of innovations regarding the machines replacing the human work flow. One of the results of these innovations are the robots. Nowadays we see robots deployed in almost every sector of the industry. They can be used in assembly lines in manufacturing industries, in services, or for defense purposes, etc. One of these robots looks like a snake and can make decision about its direction of motion. Hence, we are designing a snakelike robot, that can move by making decision itself in an unknown terrain (inspection) or can move remotely with the assist of camera. Apart from this, we also programed the snake-like robot so that it can move same as the biological Snake and can make the decisions by itself after facing problems (obstacles). The distance can be detected with the assist of IR and the visual information can be obtained using a Wi-Fi camera.
